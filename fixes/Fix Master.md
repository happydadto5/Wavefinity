# Wavefinity Fix Master

Permanent Help Code ledger. Individual fix files may be deleted after final review, but entries here remain.

This ledger was introduced after some earlier fixes already existed. The entries below reconstruct the currently visible/known fixes without inventing unavailable history.

## Fix 002 — Edge Trim Print-Bed Splitting
- **Status:** Needs remediation work
- **Fix file:** `/fixes/fix-002.md`
- **Notes:** Correction 1 is present in the fix file; keep the existing exact-perimeter/minimum-piece requirements. Await remediation/review lifecycle.

## Fix 003 — Base Trim Drop-In Joint and Size Presets
- **Status:** Work completed, ready for outside review
- **Fix file:** `/fixes/fix-003.md`
- **Implementation thread:** `Base Trim Joint Imp #3`
- **Notes:** Implementation outbrief is present in the fix file. Final completion must be determined by outside ChatGPT review before the fix file is deleted.

## Fix 004 — Space Onboarding Redesign
- **Status:** Needs remediation work — Correction 11
- **Fix file:** `/fixes/fix-004.md`
- **Implementation thread:** `Space Onboarding Redesign Imp #4`
- **Notes:** A final top-to-bottom review against the original Fix 004 requirements reopened the fix after the earlier closure. The review found remaining original-scope gaps: Surface lacks its required live units-to-mm readout and authoritative preset/trim validation; Drawer/Portable setup still accepts geometrically impossible sizes; Drawer capacity/default sizing ignores hard-wall clearance at unit boundaries; Drawer setup and untyped setup can inherit a stale prior design rather than the required fresh design; switching seeded Surface/Portable special designs back to ordinary Bin does not reliably reapply Space defaults; legacy multi-drawer configure/edit updates hard-coded `d1` instead of the active drawer; the existing-inventory replacement-folder prompt and cross-type dialog still have cancel-state defects; spacer Print grouping does not fully honor placement copy-index vs Qty semantics; and several stale pre-Fix-004 terms/helpers remain. Correction 11 consolidates these findings. Fix 005 card artwork is explicitly out of scope for Correction 11.
## Fix 005 — Space Type Card Images
- **Status:** Completed — accepted by outside ChatGPT review
- **Planning thread:** `Space Card Images Plan #5`
- **Implementation thread:** `Space Card Images Imp #5`
- **Final implementation commit:** `32b0e3958cd2cc9e2cb6f37aa9cc8cb83bab9ebb`
- **Notes:** Final review confirmed Drawer/Surface/Portable Storage use the approved `/images/Drawer.png`, `/images/Vanity.png`, and `/images/B4B.png` assets, preserve the existing visible text and full-card button interaction, use decorative empty alt text, and add consistent responsive 4:3 card styling without changing Space logic. The individual `/fixes/fix-005.md` file was deleted after acceptance per Help Code protocol. No tests were run by ChatGPT during outside review.

## Fix 006 — Portable Space Identity
- **Status:** Blocked until Fix 004 Correction 11 is accepted
- **Fix file:** `/fixes/fix-006.md`
- **Planning thread:** `Portable Space Identity Plan #6`
- **Planned implementation thread:** `Portable Space Identity Imp #6`
- **Implementation branch:** `fix6`
- **Notes:** Fully specified, but implementation is blocked again while the reopened Fix 004 Correction 11 is completed and accepted. After Fix 004 is finally accepted, create `fix6` from that then-current `origin/main` and perform all implementation/correction work there until outside review approves merge. Adds stable Space IDs, a per-user Space registry, rename recovery, and a folder-name-independent inventory filename.

## Fix 007 — Adaptive Edge Connectors
- **Status:** Requirements questions
- **Planning thread:** `Adaptive Edge Connectors Plan #7`
- **Planned implementation thread:** `Adaptive Edge Connectors Imp #7`
- **Notes:** Requirements gathering for expanded connector behavior: add three-way and four-way corner connectors, keep those corner connector types incompatible with variable height, ensure ordinary connectors derive fit from active bin wall thickness, and warn when a Space contains mixed wall thicknesses because connectors between different thicknesses are not supported. The current README already states that custom-wall connectors are generated for the selected wall thickness and are only for same-thickness bins; implementation details and warning behavior remain to be specified.
